<h1>Hi {{ username }},</h1>

<p>we're writing to share important information about your account, including recommendations about how to make your account more secure.</p>

<p>What's going on?<br/>
We have brought our password security inline with industry best practice, including tighter controls around password strength and guessability validation.</p>

<p>What is Noa doing?<br/>
To protect your information, we are sending this password reset e-mail which blocks access to your account until you reset your password.</p>

<p>What should I do?<br/>
You should <a href="{{ reset_url }}">reset your Noa password</a> using a strong and unique password. We recommend avoiding passwords used previously on other sites or services. If you used the same email and password on other sites or services, you should change your password there as well.</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions, please e-mail us at support@noa.one</p>

<p>Kind Regards,<br/>
The Noa Support Team</p>
