Hi,

We noticed someone just tried to sign up for a {{ organization_name }} account using your registered email address.

If you have not tried to sign up yourself:
You can login with this email address in the {{ organization_name }} app. In case you cannot remember your password you are able to reset it within the app.

If you have not tried to sign up yourself:
No action is required from your side, because we ignored this request for signing up.

Kind Regards,
The Noa Support Team
