{% if error %}
I encountered a fatal error: {{ error }}
{% else %}
Number of locks updated was {{ report.updated }}.
{% if report.skipped %}
Number of locks skipped was {{ report.skipped }}.
{% endif %}
{% if failed %}
Number of failures {{ report.failure }}.
{% for failure in failed %}
  - {{ failure }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% endif %}
